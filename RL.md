# Reinforcement (Deep) Learning 

RL is a subfield of machine learning which allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the optimal behavior within a given context, with a goal to maximize the long-term performance measured by a given metric.

## Markov Decision Processes

An MDP is a 5-tuple (State, actions, state transition probabilities, discount factor and reward function)
