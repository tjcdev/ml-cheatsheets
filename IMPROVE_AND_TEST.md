### Improve Performance with Data

Tactics for improving the performance with data 
- Get more data
- Invent more data (i.e. generate it)
- Clean the data
- Resample the data
- Rescale the data
- Transform the data
- Project your data (into a lower dimensional space)
- Feature selection
- Feature engineering (can you add more features)


###Â Improve Performance with Algorithms

- Spot Check Linear Algorithms
- Spot Check Nonlinear Algorithms
- Steal from the literature

### Improve Performance with Algorithm Tuning

- Diagnostics (looking at learning curves https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-control-neural-network-model-capacity-with-nodes-and-layers/)
- Random search of hyperparameters
- Grid search of hyperparameters 
- Optimize. What parameters can you optimize? Perhaps there are parameters like structure or learning rate than can be tuned using a direct search procedure (like pattern search) or stochastic optimization (like a genetic algorithm).
- Algorithm Extensions. What are common extensions to the algorithm?
- Algorithm Customizations. What customizations can be made to the algorithm for your specific case? Perhaps there are modifications that you can make to the algorithm for your data, from loss function, internal optimization methods to algorithm specific decisions.

### Improve Performance With Ensembles

- Blend Model Predictions. Take the mean or mode from the predictions of multiple well-performing models.
- Blend Data Representations. You may have many different projections of your problem which can be used to train well-performing algorithms, whose predictions can then be combined.
- Correct Predictions. Perhaps you can explicitly correct predictions or use a method like boosting to learn how to correct prediction errors.
- Learn to Combine. This is called stacked generalization or stacking and often works well when the submodels are skillful but in different ways and the aggregator model is a simple linear weighting of the predictions. This process can be repeated multiple layers deep.
